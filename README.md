# NC.js

NC.js is the Web interface for the Digital Thread.  This provides a
rich REST API for process and models as well as a matching client that
displays the 3D part models for the machining workpiece, tools, CNC,
as well as removal simulation, PMI annotations, MTConnect positional
data, QIF face status, and other aspects of a Digital Twin on the
Digital Thread.

This software uses Javascript under the Apache license, so that you
can customize the client and REST API as desired.  On the server, the
REST API uses the STEPNode native Node.js wrapper for the STEP Tools
commercial technology stack, which handles STEP and STEP-NC
read/write, analysis, geometry manipulation, and material removal
simulation.
